# Codealpha_object_tracker-task-3-
This project implements real-time object detection and tracking using YOLOv8 and a SORT-style tracker. It processes webcam or video input, detects objects with bounding boxes, assigns unique IDs for tracking, and displays results with labels in an interactive Streamlit web app. Users can also download the processed annotated video.
